# XGMP3v3 Differential Pressure Sensor
XGMP3V3 Differential Pressure Sensor for Arduino and Raspberry Pi. This repository houses codes for approximating differential pressure from the XGMP3v3 sensor on an Arduino board or analog-to-digital converter (ADC) connected to a Raspberry Pi. Calibration codes are also given, which prints raw values from an Arduino board and reads the raw values into a Python program via the serial port.
